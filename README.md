🌱 Sustainable AI-Driven Packaging Optimization System
📌 Overview

The *Sustainable AI-Driven Packaging Optimization System* is a web-based intelligent platform that designs optimized packaging solutions using Artificial Intelligence. The system minimizes material usage, reduces energy consumption, lowers cost, and decreases environmental impact while ensuring product safety and structural integrity.

This project integrates AI, geometric modeling, and sustainability principles to create an industry-relevant packaging decision-support tool.



🎯 Problem Statement

Modern packaging industries face critical challenges:

 Excessive material usage leading to waste
 High energy consumption in manufacturing and transport
 Over-designed packaging increasing cost and carbon footprint
 Manual, trial-and-error design processes

Existing CAD tools are expensive and not sustainability-focused.

This project addresses these issues by providing an AI-powered system that automatically generates optimized and eco-friendly packaging designs.
